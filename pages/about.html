      <p>
        <strong>MyTornPA</strong> is a passion project created by a dedicated Torn player who is new to programming. It all began as a way to fill time while waiting for cooldowns in-game — turning idle moments into opportunities to learn coding and develop tools that help fellow Torn players.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project represents more than just a set of utilities; it embodies the journey of a newcomer eager to build practical, reliable tools through hands-on experience. It’s crafted outside formal education or commercial pressures, fueled by curiosity and the desire to contribute to the Torn community.
      </p>
      <p>
        MyTornPA currently offers features such as monitoring faction activity, analyzing battlestats, and integrating live Torn API data. It’s constantly evolving as new ideas emerge and as skills grow, aiming to provide clear, accurate, and useful insights to enhance gameplay.
